# PredicTrade

## Purpose of Application

This is an educational project designed to teach me about machine learning and the various financial and non-financial data points that affect stock prices. I want to better understand the work that goes into quantitative firms' algorithms for predicting stock prices and automating trading decisions.

The goal is to create a working project with solid performance metrics, backtested against both my personal portfolio and randomly selected stocks from major indices (Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&P 500, Russell 2000, and potentially other US and international markets).
Three levels - My Portfolio (Buy More, Sell, Hold)
Assortment of Tracked Stocks (based off of features selected, predict price and get accuracy metrics, then give buy/no buy)
Assortment of Random Stocks (based off of features selected, predict price to get accuracy metrics, then give buy/no buy)

Additionally, I plan to investigate whether the stock market has become disconnected from the real economy by analyzing market performance against common household economic indicators.

## Planned Feature Implementation

### âœ… Completed Features

1) **Sentiment Analysis** - Orthogonal Fear-Greed Index separating Sentiment from Financial Data
   - Google Trends (35%): 70/30 US/world weighted search sentiment
   - News Sentiment (30%): Pygooglenews + TextBlob analysis
   - Professional Sentiment (20%): Finnhub financial news + social sentiment

- Volume-based indicators (OBV, Volume Rate of Change)
- Momentum indicators (Stochastic, Williams %R)

### ðŸ’° Phase 4: Fundamental Analysis Engine

- Financial ratios (P/E, P/B, P/S, EV/EBITDA, ROE, ROA)
- Growth metrics (Revenue, Earnings, FCF growth)
- Financial health metrics (Debt ratios, liquidity ratios)
