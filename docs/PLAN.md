# PredicTrade: Educational Stock Analysis & Research Platform

## Project Purpose & Vision

**PredicTrade** is an educational research platform designed to understand machine learning applications in quantitative finance. The project serves dual purposes:

1. **Educational Goal**: Learn about ML and the various financial/non-financial data points that affect stock prices, gaining insight into quantitative finance algorithms
2. **Research Goal**: Investigate whether the stock market has become disconnected from the real economy by analyzing market performance against household economic indicators
